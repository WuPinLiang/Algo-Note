# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of notes on various algorithms and data structures, likely for studying for the APCS (Advanced Placement Computer Science) exam or other competitive programming contests. The notes are written in Traditional Chinese.

## Key Files

The directory is organized by topic into the following Markdown files:

*   **`bit-hash.md`**: Covers concepts related to bit manipulation and hashing.
*   **`dp.md`**: Focuses on Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques, including subset/knapsack problems, subarray DP, and Digit DP.
*   **`graph.md`**: Contains notes on graph theory, including algorithms like DFS/BFS for finding connected components, calculating tree distances, using Disjoint Set Union (DSU), and solving problems with topological sort and tree DP.
*   **`greedy-lis.md`**: Discusses greedy algorithms and the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem.
*   **`math-string.md`**: A placeholder for future notes on mathematical algorithms and string manipulation.
*   **`misc.md`**: Contains notes on miscellaneous or hybrid topics, such as the two-pointers technique.
*   **`range-ds.md`**: Details data structures for range queries, such as Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), Segment Trees, and using `std::set` for range management.

## Usage

These files are intended as a personal knowledge base and study guide for various algorithmic concepts. They provide high-level summaries and categorize problems by the techniques used to solve them.
